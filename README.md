Iâ€™m a freelance multi-disciplinary graphic designer whoâ€™s delivered creative and engaging solutions across brand identity, print, packaging and digital media.

I have over 10 years of experience in the software development arena. To say that coding is a passion is an understatement, as it is a love that has continuously helped me overcome obstacles, embrace challenges, and keep my career moving forward. Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to add a range of capabilities to my repertoire, including JavaScript and several libraries and frameworks of this ecosystem such as React, jQuery, AngularJS and Vue.

With a solid experience with the MS-Office VBA, Visual Basic .NET, C# and ASP.NET with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework as an architectural pattern. I've started my learning path with Python and TypeScript and Iâ€™m also strengthening knowledge in Node.JS, GraphQL, MongoDB, and Express.JS, to name a few.
